    I love to take photos and videos on my camera. It is a Canon EOS M50. I like to upload my photos and videos on my MacBook Pro. I like to play around with iMovie. I still am learning how to edit videos. I want to learn how to edit photos as well. I also want to get into graphic design eventually.

    I enjoy creative writing as well. I have loved to write essays and stories since middle school. I plan to write children books and online stories one day.

    My favorite show to watch is The Bold and the Beautiful. I love the show becasue I like family, business, fashion, romance, dialogue and the use of vocabulary words in the show.
